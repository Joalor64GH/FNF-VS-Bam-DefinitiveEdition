# Friday Night Funkin' VS Bam: DEFINITIVE EDITION
VS Bam, but made even better!

# Psych Engine
Engine originally used on [Mind Games Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301107), intended to be a fix for the vanilla version's many issues while keeping the casual play aspect of it. Also aiming to be an easier alternative to newbie coders.
